# Scripts and Instructions
Clone the scripts and follow the below instructions to reproduce the results we published in the paper.

We ran simulations and generated all the results on Ubuntu 20.04 with CUDA 11.8 and GCC 9.3.0. 

These simulations took a few days on a workstation with Intel 14900K CPU and NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.
